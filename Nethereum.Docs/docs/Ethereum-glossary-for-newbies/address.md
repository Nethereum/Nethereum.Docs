##  What is an Ethereum address?

####  tl;dr
Both Ethereum accounts and contracts have what is called an _address_. Ethereum addresses look like this:

```0x88d221E36A68B19dd8aD1a5d4c21bE41a6d47b57```

Addresses are used to send, receive and use Ether, Tokens and services on Ethereum.

###  Detailed explanation
Ethereum addresses are generated using a contract's [public key](/Users/gael/Dropbox/dev/NethDocs/Nethereum.Docs/docs/Ethereum-glossary-for-newbies/public-private-key.md), they represent a contract on Ethereum and are used as the location at which you can interact with a contract.
