## What is an Ethereum message?

Contracts can call other contracts or send Ether to non-contract accounts by the means of _message calls_. Message calls are similar to transactions, in that they have a source, a target, data payload, Ether, gas and return data. In fact, every transaction consists of a top-level message call which in turn can create further message calls.
