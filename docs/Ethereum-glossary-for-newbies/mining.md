## What does mining Ethereum mean?

**tl;dr**

Mining is the process by which transactions are verified and added to an Ethereum ledger.

Mining Ethereum means verifying transactions and then aggregating them in a new block that is submitted to a blockchain. Consensus is then reached in favor of one of the submitted blocks.

The two main current mining processes are:

- PoW (Proof Of Work):

To submit a block miners have to solve a math puzzle that require important CPU

- Proof of Stake:

To submit a new block, miners must prove they own a significant amount of crypto-currency. They can be rewarded if they submit or vote for the right block, they can also be punished for supporting/submitting the wrong block.

Currently, Ethereum relies on Proof of Work, and is slated to switch to Proof of Stake soon (as of 11/30/2017)
