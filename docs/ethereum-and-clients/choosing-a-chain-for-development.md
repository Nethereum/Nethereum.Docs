# Dapps, chains and development cycle

When developing on Ethereum, different approaches are required depending on your development environment. Below are some tools we recommend:

## Local private testnet

When working in a local environment, the tools we recommend are ``` Geth Clique ```, ``` Parity PoA ``` and ``` Ganache CLI ```

### Geth Clique

Using Geth Clique allows you to test your integration with smart contracts directly in Geth with a fast Proof of Authority consensus.

[Geth Clique Manual](geth.md)

### Parity

Using Parity in combination with PoA consensus mechanism yields the same benefits as with Geth.

[Parity Clique Manual](parity.md)

### Ganache-CLI

``` Ganache CLI ``` (formerly ``` Test RPC ```) is a very common and well-documented chain emulator.

Ganache inherits Truffle suite's benefits: mainly simplifying Smart Contracts testing, debugging and updating. Ganache has a quasi-immediate response time and great feedback cycle.
It's great to deploy contracts and interact with them instantly at no GAS cost.

## Cloud private testnet

Azure BaaS (Blockchain as a Service) allows you to deploy a testnet with several nodes and have a team work on the development.

## Public testnets

Public testnets function in the same way main nets work, with two differences:
* They are free: transactions are paid with a worthless crypto-currency
* They are often more responsive than main nets 

The main public testchains are:

#### 1. Rinkeby

Cross-client testnet using PoA consensus mechanism.

#### 2. Kovan

Cross-client testnet (working with both Parity and Geth) using PoA consensus mechanism and a particular focus on spam-resilience.

#### 3. Ropsten

Less popular since hacked early 2017, however, Ropsten is still in service.

Note: public testnets can be accessed via public nodes such as [INFURA](https://www.infura.io) 


## Ether Faucets

The ether and tokens used in test networks is for testing purposes only (it can accurately be compared to Monopoly bills). It's mostly distributed by online "faucets". 

Here's a list of testnet Ether sources:

| Testnet Name | Faucet|
|----------------------|-------|
|Rinkeby| https://www.rinkeby.io/#faucet|
|Ropsten|https://blog.b9lab.com/when-we-first-built-our-faucet-we-deployed-it-on-the-morden-testnet-70bfbf4e317e|
| Kovan | Kovan requires you to request KETH from another person|
