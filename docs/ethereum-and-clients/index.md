#Ethereum Clients

To integrate with Ethereum, Nethereum requires an Ethereum client node like Geth, parity, Quorum etc with RPC / IPC enabled.

The client might be installed locally, a server you control or be a public node depending on your needs and use case. For smart contract development you can also install [Test RPC](test-rpc.md), which provides a very fast Ethereum simulator with a great feedback cycle.

For example, if you are just interested in retrieving existing data from contracts, or sending offline signed transactions from the Ethereum public chain, you can just use a public node like [Infura](https://infura.io/) without the need to install locally a node client like [Parity](parity.md) or [Geth](geth.md).
