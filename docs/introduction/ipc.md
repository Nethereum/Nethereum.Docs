#IPC

Nethereum provides an IPC client to communicate with clients. IPC comnunication behaves in the same way as RPC / HTTP, the only thing that it changes is the Client implementation.

First you will need to install the ``` Nethereum.JsonRpc.IpcClient ``` nuget. There are two types of IPCClients, Windows which uses NamedPipes and Unix/Linux.

## Windows environment
In Windows we need to use the ```Nethereum.JsonRpc.IpcClient.IpcClient```. The new IpcClient will be configured with the NamedPipes file name. Geth uses as default "geth.ipc" and Parity "jsonrpc.ipc".

```csharp
var client = Nethereum.JsonRpc.IpcClient.IpcClient("jsonrpc.ipc");
```

## Unix environment
In Unix / Linux we need to use the ```Nethereum.JsonRpc.IpcClient.UnixIpcClient```. The new IpcClient will be configured with the full file path of the IPC file. In this scenario, because we have configured the Geth path "devChain", the file will be found in the root directory.

```csharp
var client = Nethereum.JsonRpc.IpcClient.UnixIpcClient("/Users/juanblanco/Documents/Repos/Nethereum.Workbooks/testchain/clique/devChain/geth.ipc");
```
## Creating a Web3 instance

Finally we can create an instance of Web3 using the new IPC Client.

```csharp
var web3 = new Nethereum.Web3.Web3(client);
```
