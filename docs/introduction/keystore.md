# Key Store

The library Nethereum.KeyStore allows the decrytion and the encryption of private keys which using the [Web3 Secret Storage Definition](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Web3-Secret-Storage-Definition).
This is the same standard followed by node clients like geth, eth or parity.

## Usage

### Key decryption and retrieval

To retrieve a key from a file stored using the  web3 secret storage definition you will need to do the following:

```csharp
var file = File.OpenText("UTC--2015-11-25T05-05-03.116905600Z--12890d2cce102216644c59dae5baed380d84830c");
var json = file.ReadToEnd();
```

First open the file and extract the json content, key store files can normally be found on the directory "keystore" on the following directories:

* Mac: ~/Library/Ethereum
* Linux: ~/.ethereum
* Windows: %APPDATA%\Ethereum

If using parity the keys can be found under the directory "keys" on $HOME/.parity/keys

To decrypt and extract the private key from the json file we can just use the KeyStoreService with a password.

```csharp
var password = "password";
//using the simple key store service
var service = new KeyStoreService();
//decrypt the private key
var key = service.DecryptKeyStoreFromJson(password, json);
```

### KeyStore encryption and creation

First we will need to create the standard file name, which includes the UTC time and account address.

Then we will use the password to encrypt and store the private key into a JSON formatted output, which will be saved into the file.

```csharp
var fileName = service.GenerateUTCFileName(address);
using (var newfile = File.CreateText(fileName))
{
    //generate the encrypted and key store content as json. (The default uses pbkdf2)
    var newJson = service.EncryptAndGenerateDefaultKeyStoreAsJson(password, key, address);
    newfile.Write(newJson);
    newfile.Flush();
}


```
