# Nethereum.Abi.Autogen Nuget Package
## A quick path to Dot Net and Ethereum integration
Nethereum offers a code generator which allows you to generates dot net classes from the ABI and Bin output of the compilation of Solidity contracts.  This generator has a range of front end options (CLI, windows, web, mobile etc).  The Nethereum.Abi.Autogen package incorporates the generator and provides the quickest path to Dot Net and Ethereum integration.  Once the package is added to a project, C# files will be generated during pre-build of the target project based on any solidity files (abi, bin) present in the project (or optionally based on a config file). These code files provide a basis for deploying and interacting with smart contracts.

The Nuget package attaches a build targets file to the project, which injects a pre build task during which the code generation occurs. 

## Prerequisites: 

* [Visual Studio Code (windows/Linux or Mac)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or Visual Studio.
* Dot Net Core 2.1 must be installed on the machine. The code generator runs on Dot Net Core 2.1, BUT your target project does not need to be a Dot Net core project.  [(Download Dot Net Core)](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/windows)
* The abi and bin files from one or more compiled Solidity contracts. [(Solidity contract examples)](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/solidity-by-example.html)

## Instructions

### Step 1 - Create the target project:

In your IDE (Visual Studio or VS Code) - or using the Dot Net CLI - Create a project.  You can use an existing project if desired.

### Step 2 - Create a folder for your Solidity abi and bin files:

Create a sub folder for your Solidity files (abi, bin).  This is optional - they can be at the root of the project or in any sub folder of the project.  By default the root project and all sub folders will be scanned for abi files.

If you prefer to have the solidity files in a folder which is not within the project, you will need to create a Nethereum.Generator.json file at the root of your project.  If this file is present, then only abi files referenced in that file will be code generated.  See [Config Driven Generation](#config-driven-generation).

### Step 3 - Put your abi and bin files in the folder:

Put copies of your abi and bin files in the sub folder.  (bin files should have the same name as abi e.g. StandardContract.abi, StandardContract.bin).

### Step 4 - Add Nethereum.Web3 nuget package:

Add Nethereum.Web3 nuget (2.5.1 is the current version at the time of writing)

Nuget Console Command
```
Install-Package Nethereum.Web3
```

### Step 5 - Add Nethereum.Abi.Autogen package:

Add Nethereum.Abi.Autogen nuget

Nuget Console Command
```
Install-Package Nethereum.Abi.Autogen
```

### Step 6 - Build the project:

Build the project.  You should see a folder created in the project for each abi file.  For Dot Net Core projects this will be obvious in the IDE as the files will be visible in the project, for .Net Framework v4.* projects check the project folder in the file system.

## Disabling code generation

If code generation on every build is not required it can be disabled.
The code generation can be bypassed by adding the following property to the csproj file.  The property is not there by default.  Once code generation is stopped the reference to the Nethereum.Abi.Autogen package can be dropped, but if any generated C# files exist, the reference to Nethereum.Web3 must remain.

``` xml
  <PropertyGroup>
  <!-- Set to false to disable code generation -->
    <NethereumGenerateCode>true</NethereumGenerateCode>
  </PropertyGroup>
```
## Gotchas

* Project Names with unusual characters.  Abi Autogen relies on a convention based approach to naming.  It will generated classes and namespaces based on the project name and solidity abi file names.  Beware that these can create a problem when building particularly where the names contain special characters or clash with other parts of your codebase.  When build issues arise due to this, the simplest approach is to rename the project and project folder and perhaps the solidity files.  However if more control is required - See [Config Driven Generation](#config-driven-generation).
* For Dot Net Core projects - code generated files will automatically be included as part of the target project.  For Framework v4.* projects, the code generated files will be placed in the project folder but will not automatically be included in the project - they must be manually added to the project after generation.

## Config Driven Generation

Where more control is required over code generation - or where your abi files are located outside of the project you can switch to a config file based approach.

Create a json file called "Nethereum.Generator.json" in the root of the project.  The contents of this file will then control code generation.

Be aware that if a config file is present - ONLY abi files in the config will be generated, the project will not be scanned for other abi files.

``` json
{
	"ABIConfigurations": [
	{
		"ContractName":"StandardContractA",
		"ABI":null,
		"ABIFile":"Ballot.abi",
		"ByteCode":null,
		"BinFile":"Ballot.bin",
		"BaseNamespace":null,
		"CQSNamespace":null,
		"DTONamespace":null,
		"ServiceNamespace":null,
		"CodeGenLanguage":"CSharp",
		"BaseOutputPath":null}
	]
}
```
### Configuration Info
* ABI - the actual ABI content (optional)
* ABIFile - the path (relative or absolute) to the abi file (optional)
* Either ABI or ABIFile must be specified
* ByteCode - the actual ByteCode (optional)
* BinFile - the path (relative or absolute) to the bin file (optional)
* Both ByteCode and BinFile are optional
* CodeGenLanguages: CSharp,Vb,FSharp (CSharp is default)

## Alternatives for Code Generation

The Netherum.Abi.Autogen uses the Nethereum.Generator.Console under the hood.  It is possible to use this in isolation.
